### Getting Started

This repo uses pnpm workspaces with node 18+, and [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html). (Windows users can install [watchman via chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/watchman))

With those set up, clone this repo and run `pnpm install`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-website
cd TypeScript-website
pnpm install
code .

# Then:
pnpm bootstrap
# Optional, grab the translations:
pnpm docs-sync pull microsoft/TypeScript-Website-localizations#main 1

# Now you can start up the website
pnpm start
```

Working on this repo is done by running `pnpm start` - this starts up the website on port `8000` and creates a
builder worker for every package in the repo, so if you make a change outside of the site it will compile and lint etc.

Some useful knowledge you need to know:

- All packages have: `pnpm build` and `pnpm test`
- All packages use [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) - which means you can do `env DEBUG="*" pnpm test` to get verbose logs

Having issues getting set up? [Consult the troubleshooting](./docs/Setup%20Troubleshooting.md).

## Deployment

Deployment is automatic:

- Pushes to the branch `v2` deploy to [production](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

You can find the build logs in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website/actions)

## Docs

If you want to know _in-depth_ how this website works, there is an [hour long video covering the codebase, deployment and tooling on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOvivt6B7hE). Otherwise there are some short guides:

- [Converting Twoslash Code Samples](./docs/Converting%20Twoslash%20Code%20Samples.md)
- [How i18n Works For Site Copy](./docs/How%20i18n%20Works%20For%20Site%20Copy.md)
- [Updating the TypeScript Version](./docs/New%20TypeScript%20Version.md)
- [Something Went Wrong](./docs/Something%20Went%20Wrong.md)

## Changesets

This repo uses `pnpm` + `changesets` to manage package version bumps and releases.

CI will fail if a PR modifies a public package but is missing a changeset. To add a changeset, run `pnpm changeset`, then follow along with the CLI.

```console
$ pnpm changeset
ðŸ¦‹  Which packages would you like to include? â€¦ 
â—¯ changed packages
  â—¯ create-typescript-playground-plugin
  â—¯ @typescript/vfs
  â—¯ @typescript/twoslash
  â—¯ @typescript/sandbox
  â—¯ @typescript/ata
```

New files will be created in `.changeset` and must be committed.

PRs which don't modify public packages (e.g. website content updates) do not require changesets.
If you are making a change to a published package but are not affecting published code, you can create an empty changeset for your PR with `pnpm changeset --empty`.

# Website Packages

## TypeScriptLang-Org

The main website for TypeScript, a Gatsby website which is statically deployed. You can run it via:

```sh
pnpm start
```

To optimize even more, the env var `NO_TRANSLATIONS` as truthy will make the website only load pages for English.

## Sandbox

The editor aspect of the TypeScript Playground REPL, useable for all sites which want to show a monaco editor
with TypeScript or JavaScript code.

## Playground

The JS code has an AMD module for the playground which is loaded at runtime in the Playground website.

# Doc Packages

## TSConfig Reference

A set of tools and scripts for generating a comprehensive API reference for the TSConfig JSON file.

```sh
# Generate JSON from the typescript cli
pnpm run --filter=tsconfig-reference generate-json
# Jams them all into a single file
pnpm run --filter=tsconfig-reference generate-markdown
```

Validate the docs:

```sh
pnpm run --filter=tsconfig-reference test

# or to just run the linter without a build
pnpm run --filter=tsconfig-reference lint

# or to just one one linter for a single doc
pnpm run --filter=tsconfig-reference lint resolveJson
```

## Documentation

The docs for TypeScript. Originally ported over from [microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/) then intermingled with [microsoft/TypeScript-New-Handbook](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-New-Handbook).

## JSON Schema

It's a little odd, but the `tsconfig-reference` package creates the JSON schema for a TSConfig files:

```sh
pnpm run --filter=tsconfig-reference build
```

Then you can find it at: [`packages/tsconfig-reference/scripts/schema/result/schema.json`](packages/tsconfig-reference/scripts/schema/result/schema.json).

## Playground Handbook

The user-facing documentation for the Playground.

## Playground Examples

The code samples used in the Playground split across many languages.

# Infra Packages

Most of these packages use (a maintained [fork](https://github.com/weiran-zsd/dts-cli) of) [`tsdx`](https://tsdx.io).

## TS Twoslash

A code sample markup extension for TypeScript. Available on npm: [@typescript/twoslash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript/twoslash)

## TypeScript VFS

A comprehensive way to run TypeScript projects in-memory in a browser or node environment. Available on npm: [@typescript/vfs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript/vfs)

## Create Playground Plugin

A template for generating a new playground plugin which you can use via `npm init playground-plugin [name]`

## Community Meta

Generates contribution JSON metadata on who edited handbook pages.

## Playground Worker

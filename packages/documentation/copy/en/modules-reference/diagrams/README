Some of this content uses mermaid diagrams. We could render them as part of the website build with gatsby-remark-mermaid, but that requires puppeteer/Chromium, which has historically caused a lot of cross-platform build issues. These diagrams should not change often, so I’m just going to store the source here and generate the SVGs manually.

Example:

```sh
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
cd packages/documentation/copy/en/modules-reference/diagrams
mmdc -c mermaid.config.json -i esm-cjs-interop.md
```

declaration-files.svg is a non-Mermaid replacement for theory.md-4.svg. I made it for a talk one time and it’s better than what Mermaid can do with a flowchart.

In this chapter, we'll cover some of the most common types of values you'll find in JavaScript code, and explain the corresponding ways to describe those types in TypeScript.
This isn't an exhaustive list, and future chapters will describe more ways to name and use other types.

Types can also appear in many more _places_ than just type annotations.
As we learn about the types themselves, we'll also learn about the places where we can refer to these types to form new constructs.

We'll start by reviewing the most basic and common types you might encounter when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code.
These will later form the core building blocks of more complex types.

## The primitives: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`

JavaScript has three very commonly used [primitives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive): `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript.
As you might expect, these are the same names you'd see if you used the JavaScript `typeof` operator on a value of those types:

- `string` represents string values like `"Hello, world"`
- `number` is for numbers like `42`. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there's no equivalent to `int` or `float` - everything is simply `number`
- `boolean` is for the two values `true` and `false`

> The type names `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code. _Always_ use `string`, `number`, or `boolean` for types.

## Arrays

To specify the type of an array like `[1, 2, 3]`, you can use the syntax `number[]`; this syntax works for any type (e.g. `string[]` is an array of strings, and so on).
You may also see this written as `Array<number>`, which means the same thing.
We'll learn more about the syntax `T<U>` when we cover _generics_.

> Note that `[number]` is a different thing; refer to the section on [Tuples](/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#tuple-types).

## `any`

TypeScript also has a special type, `any`, that you can use whenever you don't want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

When a value is of type `any`, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type `any`), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that's syntactically legal:

```ts twoslash
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```

The `any` type is useful when you don't want to write out a long type just to convince TypeScript that a particular line of code is okay.

### `noImplicitAny`

When you don't specify a type, and TypeScript can't infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to `any`.

You usually want to avoid this, though, because `any` isn't type-checked.
Use the compiler flag [`noImplicitAny`](/tsconfig#noImplicitAny) to flag any implicit `any` as an error.

## Type Annotations on Variables

When you declare a variable using `const`, `var`, or `let`, you can optionally add a type annotation to explicitly specify the type of the variable:

```ts twoslash
let myName: string = "Alice";
//        ^^^^^^^^ Type annotation
```

> TypeScript doesn't use "types on the left"-style declarations like `int x = 0;`
> Type annotations will always go _after_ the thing being typed.

In most cases, though, this isn't needed.
Wherever possible, TypeScript tries to automatically _infer_ the types in your code.
For example, the type of a variable is inferred based on the type of its initializer:

```ts twoslash
// No type annotation needed -- 'myName' inferred as type 'string'
let myName = "Alice";
```

For the most part you don't need to explicitly learn the rules of inference.
If you're starting out, try using fewer type annotations than you think - you might be surprised how few you need for TypeScript to fully understand what's going on.

## Functions

Functions are the primary means of passing data around in JavaScript.
TypeScript allows you to specify the types of both the input and output values of functions.

### Parameter Type Annotations

When you declare a function, you can add type annotations after each parameter to declare what types of parameters the function accepts.
Parameter type annotations go after the parameter name:

```ts twoslash
// Parameter type annotation
function greet(name: string) {
  //                 ^^^^^^^^
  console.log("Hello, " + name.toUpperCase() + "!!");
}
```

When a parameter has a type annotation, arguments to that function will be checked:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
declare function greet(name: string): void;
// ---cut---
// Would be a runtime error if executed!
greet(42);
```

> Even if you don't have type annotations on your parameters, TypeScript will still check that you passed the right number of arguments.

### Return Type Annotations

You can also add return type annotations.
Return type annotations appear after the parameter list:

```ts twoslash
function getFavoriteNumber(): number {
  //                        ^^^^^^^^
  return 26;
}
```

Much like variable type annotations, you usually don't need a return type annotation because TypeScript will infer the function's return type based on its `return` statements.
The type annotation in the above example doesn't change anything.
Some codebases will explicitly specify a return type for documentation purposes, to prevent accidental changes, or just for personal preference.

#### Functions Which Return Promises

If you want to annotate the return type of a function which returns a promise, you should use the `Promise` type:

```ts twoslash
async function getFavoriteNumber(): Promise<number> {
  return 26;
}
```

### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are a little bit different from function declarations.
When a function appears in a place where TypeScript can determine how it's going to be called, the parameters of that function are automatically given types.

Here's an example:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2551
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"];

// Contextual typing for function - parameter s inferred to have type string
names.forEach(function (s) {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});

// Contextual typing also applies to arrow functions
names.forEach((s) => {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});
```

Even though the parameter `s` didn't have a type annotation, TypeScript used the types of the `forEach` function, along with the inferred type of the array, to determine the type `s` will have.

This process is called _contextual typing_ because the _context_ that the function occurred within informs what type it should have.

Similar to the inference rules, you don't need to explicitly learn how this happens, but understanding that it _does_ happen can help you notice when type annotations aren't needed.
Later, we'll see more examples of how the context that a value occurs in can affect its type.

## Object Types

Apart from primitives, the most common sort of type you'll encounter is an _object type_.
This refers to any JavaScript value with properties, which is almost all of them!
To define an object type, we simply list its properties and their types.

For example, here's a function that takes a point-like object:

```ts twoslash
// The parameter's type annotation is an object type
function printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {
  //                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });
```

Here, we annotated the parameter with a type with two properties - `x` and `y` - which are both of type `number`.
You can use `,` or `;` to separate the properties, and the last separator is optional either way.

The type part of each property is also optional.
If you don't specify a type, it will be assumed to be `any`.

### Optional Properties

Object types can also specify that some or all of their properties are _optional_.
To do this, add a `?` after the property name:

```ts twoslash
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // ...
}
// Both OK
printName({ first: "Bob" });
printName({ first: "Alice", last: "Alisson" });
```

In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn't exist, you'll get the value `undefined` rather than a runtime error.
Because of this, when you _read_ from an optional property, you'll have to check for `undefined` before using it.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 18048
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // Error - might crash if 'obj.last' wasn't provided!
  console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
  if (obj.last !== undefined) {
    // OK
    console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
  }

  // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax:
  console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());
}
```

## Union Types

TypeScript's type system allows you to build new types out of existing ones using a large variety of operators.
Now that we know how to write a few types, it's time to start _combining_ them in interesting ways.

### Defining a Union Type

The first way to combine types you might see is a _union_ type.
A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be _any one_ of those types.
We refer to each of these types as the union's _members_.

Let's write a function that can operate on strings or numbers:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);
}
// OK
printId(101);
// OK
printId("202");
// Error
printId({ myID: 22342 });
```

> The separator of the union members is allowed before the first element, so you could also write this:
> ```ts twoslash
> function printTextOrNumberOrBool(
>   textOrNumberOrBool:
>     | string
>     | number
>     | boolean
> ) {
>   console.log(textOrNumberOrBool);
> }
> ```

### Working with Union Types

It's easy to _provide_ a value matching a union type - simply provide a type matching any of the union's members.
If you _have_ a value of a union type, how do you work with it?

TypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for _every_ member of the union.
For example, if you have the union `string | number`, you can't use methods that are only available on `string`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log(id.toUpperCase());
}
```

The solution is to _narrow_ the union with code, the same as you would in JavaScript without type annotations.
_Narrowing_ occurs when TypeScript can deduce a more specific type for a value based on the structure of the code.

For example, TypeScript knows that only a `string` value will have a `typeof` value `"string"`:

```ts twoslash
function printId(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    // In this branch, id is of type 'string'
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // Here, id is of type 'number'
    console.log(id);
  }
}
```

Another example is to use a function like `Array.isArray`:

```ts twoslash
function welcomePeople(x: string[] | string) {
  if (Array.isArray(x)) {
    // Here: 'x' is 'string[]'
    console.log("Hello, " + x.join(" and "));
  } else {
    // Here: 'x' is 'string'
    console.log("Welcome lone traveler " + x);
  }
}
```

Notice that in the `else` branch, we don't need to do anything special - if `x` wasn't a `string[]`, then it must have been a `string`.

Sometimes you'll have a union where all the members have something in common.
For example, both arrays and strings have a `slice` method.
If every member in a union has a property in common, you can use that property without narrowing:

```ts twoslash
// Return type is inferred as number[] | string
function getFirstThree(x: number[] | string) {
  return x.slice(0, 3);
}
```

> It might be confusing that a _union_ of types appears to have the _intersection_ of those types' properties.
> This is not an accident - the name _union_ comes from type theory.
> The _union_ `number | string` is composed by taking the union _of the values_ from each type.
> Notice that given two sets with corresponding facts about each set, only the _intersection_ of those facts applies to the _union_ of the sets themselves.
> For example, if we had a room of tall people wearing hats, and another room of Spanish speakers wearing hats, after combining those rooms, the only thing we know about _every_ person is that they must be wearing a hat.

## Type Aliases

We've been using object types and union types by writing them directly in type annotations.
This is convenient, but it's common to want to use the same type more than once and refer to it by a single name.

A _type alias_ is exactly that - a _name_ for any _type_.
The syntax for a type alias is:

```ts twoslash
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

// Exactly the same as the earlier example
function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}

printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```

You can actually use a type alias to give a name to any type at all, not just an object type.
For example, a type alias can name a union type:

```ts twoslash
type ID = number | string;
```

Note that aliases are _only_ aliases - you cannot use type aliases to create different/distinct "versions" of the same type.
When you use the alias, it's exactly as if you had written the aliased type.
In other words, this code might _look_ illegal, but is OK according to TypeScript because both types are aliases for the same type:

```ts twoslash
declare function getInput(): string;
declare function sanitize(str: string): string;
// ---cut---
type UserInputSanitizedString = string;

function sanitizeInput(str: string): UserInputSanitizedString {
  return sanitize(str);
}

// Create a sanitized input
let userInput = sanitizeInput(getInput());

// Can still be re-assigned with a string though
userInput = "new input";
```

## Interfaces

An _interface declaration_ is another way to name an object type:

```ts twoslash
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}

printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```

Just like when we used a type alias above, the example works just as if we had used an anonymous object type.
TypeScript is only concerned with the _structure_ of the value we passed to `printCoord` - it only cares that it has the expected properties.
Being concerned only with the structure and capabilities of types is why we call TypeScript a _structurally typed_ type system.

### Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces

Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely.
Almost all features of an `interface` are available in `type`, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

        </pre></code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</div>

You'll learn more about these concepts in later chapters, so don't worry if you don't understand all of these right away.

- Prior to TypeScript version 4.2, type alias names [_may_ appear in error messages](/play?#code/PTAEGEHsFsAcEsA2BTATqNrLusgzngIYDm+oA7koqIYuYQJ56gCueyoAUCKAC4AWHAHaFcoSADMaQ0PCG80EwgGNkALk6c5C1EtWgAsqOi1QAb06groEbjWg8vVHOKcAvpokshy3vEgyyMr8kEbQJogAFND2YREAlOaW1soBeJAoAHSIkMTRmbbI8e6aPMiZxJmgACqCGKhY6ABGyDnkFFQ0dIzMbBwCwqIccabcYLyQoKjIEmh8kwN8DLAc5PzwwbLMyAAeK77IACYaQSEjUWZWhfYAjABMAMwALA+gbsVjoADqgjKESytQPxCHghAByXigYgBfr8LAsYj8aQMUASbDQcRSExCeCwFiIQh+AKfAYyBiQFgOPyIaikSGLQo0Zj-aazaY+dSaXjLDgAGXgAC9CKhDqAALxJaw2Ib2RzOISuDycLw+ImBYKQflCkWRRD2LXCw6JCxS1JCdJZHJ5RAFIbFJU8ADKC3WzEcnVZaGYE1ABpFnFOmsFhsil2uoHuzwArO9SmAAEIsSFrZB-GgAjjA5gtVN8VCEc1o1C4Q4AGlR2AwO1EsBQoAAbvB-gJ4HhPgB5aDwem-Ph1TCV3AEEirTp4ELtRbTPD4vwKjOfAuioSQHuDXBcnmgACC+eCONFEs73YAPGGZVT5cRyyhiHh7AAON7lsG3vBggB8XGV3l8-nVISOgghxoLq9i7io-AHsayRWGaFrlFauq2rg9qaIGQHwCBqChtKdgRo8TxRjeyB3o+7xAA), sometimes in place of the equivalent anonymous type (which may or may not be desirable). Interfaces will always be named in error messages.
- Type aliases may not participate [in declaration merging, but interfaces can](/play?#code/PTAEEEDtQS0gXApgJwGYEMDGjSfdAIx2UQFoB7AB0UkQBMAoEUfO0Wgd1ADd0AbAK6IAzizp16ALgYM4SNFhwBZdAFtV-UAG8GoPaADmNAcMmhh8ZHAMMAvjLkoM2UCvWad+0ARL0A-GYWVpA29gyY5JAWLJAwGnxmbvGgALzauvpGkCZmAEQAjABMAMwALLkANBl6zABi6DB8okR4Jjg+iPSgABboovDk3jjo5pbW1d6+dGb5djLwAJ7UoABKiJTwjThpnpnGpqPBoTLMAJrkArj4kOTwYmycPOhW6AR8IrDQ8N04wmo4HHQCwYi2Waw2W1S6S8HX8gTGITsQA).
- Interfaces may only be used to [declare the shapes of objects, not rename primitives](/play?#code/PTAEAkFMCdIcgM6gC4HcD2pIA8CGBbABwBtIl0AzUAKBFAFcEBLAOwHMUBPQs0XFgCahWyGBVwBjMrTDJMAshOhMARpD4tQ6FQCtIE5DWoixk9QEEWAeV37kARlABvaqDegAbrmL1IALlAEZGV2agBfampkbgtrWwMAJlAAXmdXdy8ff0Dg1jZwyLoAVWZ2Lh5QVHUJflAlSFxROsY5fFAWAmk6CnRoLGwmILzQQmV8JmQmDzI-SOiKgGV+CaYAL0gBBdyy1KCQ-Pn1AFFplgA5enw1PtSWS+vCsAAVAAtB4QQWOEMKBuYVUiVCYvYQsUTQcRSBDGMGmKSgAAa-VEgiQe2GLgKQA).

- Using interfaces with `extends` [can often be more performant for the compiler](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Performance#preferring-interfaces-over-intersections) than type aliases with intersections

For the most part, you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will tell you if it needs something to be the other kind of declaration. If you would like a heuristic, use `interface` until you need to use features from `type`.

## Type Assertions

Sometimes you will have information about the type of a value that TypeScript can't know about.

For example, if you're using `document.getElementById`, TypeScript only knows that this will return _some_ kind of `HTMLElement`, but you might know that your page will always have an `HTMLCanvasElement` with a given ID.

In this situation, you can use a _type assertion_ to specify a more specific type:

```ts twoslash
const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
```

Like a type annotation, type assertions are removed by the compiler and won't affect the runtime behavior of your code.

You can also use the angle-bracket syntax (except if the code is in a `.tsx` file), which is equivalent:

```ts twoslash
const myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");
```

> Reminder: Because type assertions are removed at compile-time, there is no runtime checking associated with a type assertion.
> There won't be an exception or `null` generated if the type assertion is wrong.

TypeScript only allows type assertions which convert to a _more specific_ or _less specific_ version of a type.
This rule prevents "impossible" coercions like:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2352
const x = "hello" as number;
```

Sometimes this rule can be too conservative and will disallow more complex coercions that might be valid.
If this happens, you can use two assertions, first to `any` (or `unknown`, which we'll introduce later), then to the desired type:

```ts twoslash
declare const expr: any;
type T = { a: 1; b: 2; c: 3 };
// ---cut---
const a = expr as any as T;
```

## Literal Types

In addition to the general types `string` and `number`, we can refer to _specific_ strings and numbers in type positions.

One way to think about this is to consider how JavaScript comes with different ways to declare a variable. Both `var` and `let` allow for changing what is held inside the variable, and `const` does not. This is reflected in how TypeScript creates types for literals.

```ts twoslash
let changingString = "Hello World";
changingString = "Olá Mundo";
// Because `changingString` can represent any possible string, that
// is how TypeScript describes it in the type system
changingString;
// ^?

const constantString = "Hello World";
// Because `constantString` can only represent 1 possible string, it
// has a literal type representation
constantString;
// ^?
```

By themselves, literal types aren't very valuable:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
let x: "hello" = "hello";
// OK
x = "hello";
// ...
x = "howdy";
```

It's not much use to have a variable that can only have one value!

But by _combining_ literals into unions, you can express a much more useful concept - for example, functions that only accept a certain set of known values:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
function printText(s: string, alignment: "left" | "right" | "center") {
  // ...
}
printText("Hello, world", "left");
printText("G'day, mate", "centre");
```

Numeric literal types work the same way:

```ts twoslash
function compare(a: string, b: string): -1 | 0 | 1 {
  return a === b ? 0 : a > b ? 1 : -1;
}
```

Of course, you can combine these with non-literal types:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
interface Options {
  width: number;
}
function configure(x: Options | "auto") {
  // ...
}
configure({ width: 100 });
configure("auto");
configure("automatic");
```

There's one more kind of literal type: boolean literals.
There are only two boolean literal types, and as you might guess, they are the types `true` and `false`.
The type `boolean` itself is actually just an alias for the union `true | false`.

### Literal Inference

When you initialize a variable with an object, TypeScript assumes that the properties of that object might change values later.
For example, if you wrote code like this:

```ts twoslash
declare const someCondition: boolean;
// ---cut---
const obj = { counter: 0 };
if (someCondition) {
  obj.counter = 1;
}
```

TypeScript doesn't assume the assignment of `1` to a field which previously had `0` is an error.
Another way of saying this is that `obj.counter` must have the type `number`, not `0`, because types are used to determine both _reading_ and _writing_ behavior.

The same applies to strings:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
declare function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void;

const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" };
handleRequest(req.url, req.method);
```

In the above example `req.method` is inferred to be `string`, not `"GET"`. Because code can be evaluated between the creation of `req` and the call of `handleRequest` which could assign a new string like `"GUESS"` to `req.method`, TypeScript considers this code to have an error.

There are two ways to work around this.

1. You can change the inference by adding a type assertion in either location:

   ```ts twoslash
   declare function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void;
   // ---cut---
   // Change 1:
   const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" as "GET" };
   // Change 2
   handleRequest(req.url, req.method as "GET");
   ```

   Change 1 means "I intend for `req.method` to always have the _literal type_ `"GET"`", preventing the possible assignment of `"GUESS"` to that field after.
   Change 2 means "I know for other reasons that `req.method` has the value `"GET"`".

2. You can use `as const` to convert the entire object to be type literals:

   ```ts twoslash
   declare function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void;
   // ---cut---
   const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" } as const;
   handleRequest(req.url, req.method);
   ```

The `as const` suffix acts like `const` but for the type system, ensuring that all properties are assigned the literal type instead of a more general version like `string` or `number`.

## `null` and `undefined`

JavaScript has two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value: `null` and `undefined`.

TypeScript has two corresponding _types_ by the same names. How these types behave depends on whether you have the [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) option on.

### `strictNullChecks` off

With [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) _off_, values that might be `null` or `undefined` can still be accessed normally, and the values `null` and `undefined` can be assigned to a property of any type.
This is similar to how languages without null checks (e.g. C#, Java) behave.
The lack of checking for these values tends to be a major source of bugs; we always recommend people turn [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) on if it's practical to do so in their codebase.

### `strictNullChecks` on

With [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) _on_, when a value is `null` or `undefined`, you will need to test for those values before using methods or properties on that value.
Just like checking for `undefined` before using an optional property, we can use _narrowing_ to check for values that might be `null`:

```ts twoslash
function doSomething(x: string | null) {
  if (x === null) {
    // do nothing
  } else {
    console.log("Hello, " + x.toUpperCase());
  }
}
```

### Non-null Assertion Operator (Postfix `!`)

TypeScript also has a special syntax for removing `null` and `undefined` from a type without doing any explicit checking.
Writing `!` after any expression is effectively a type assertion that the value isn't `null` or `undefined`:

```ts twoslash
function liveDangerously(x?: number | null) {
  // No error
  console.log(x!.toFixed());
}
```

Just like other type assertions, this doesn't change the runtime behavior of your code, so it's important to only use `!` when you know that the value _can't_ be `null` or `undefined`.

## Enums

Enums are a feature added to JavaScript by TypeScript which allows for describing a value which could be one of a set of possible named constants. Unlike most TypeScript features, this is _not_ a type-level addition to JavaScript but something added to the language and runtime. Because of this, it's a feature which you should know exists, but maybe hold off on using unless you are sure. You can read more about enums in the [Enum reference page](/docs/handbook/enums.html).

## Less Common Primitives

It's worth mentioning the rest of the primitives in JavaScript which are represented in the type system.
Though we will not go into depth here.

#### `bigint`

From ES2020 onwards, there is a primitive in JavaScript used for very large integers, `BigInt`:

```ts twoslash
// @target: es2020

// Creating a bigint via the BigInt function
const oneHundred: bigint = BigInt(100);

// Creating a BigInt via the literal syntax
const anotherHundred: bigint = 100n;
```

You can learn more about BigInt in [the TypeScript 3.2 release notes](/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-2.html#bigint).

#### `symbol`

There is a primitive in JavaScript used to create a globally unique reference via the function `Symbol()`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2367
const firstName = Symbol("name");
const secondName = Symbol("name");

if (firstName === secondName) {
  // Can't ever happen
}
```

You can learn more about them in [Symbols reference page](/docs/handbook/symbols.html).

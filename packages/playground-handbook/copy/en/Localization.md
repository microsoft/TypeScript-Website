## Localization

Like the rest of this website, the TypeScript Playground is localized. As of 2021, the current list of supported languages are:

- [`es`](/es/play)
- [`fr`](/fr/play)
- [`id`](/id/play)
- [`ja`](/ja/play)
- [`ko`](/ko/play)
- [`pt`](/pt/play)
- [`vo`](/vo/play)
- [`zh`](/zh/play)

Ideally this helps folks for whom English is a second language!

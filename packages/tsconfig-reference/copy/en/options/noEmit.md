Do not emit compiler output files like JavaScript source code, source-maps or declarations. 

This leaves another tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io), or [swc](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) to handle converting the TypeScript file to a file which can run inside a JavaScript environment. 

You can then use TypeScript as a tool for providing editor integration, and as a source code linter.

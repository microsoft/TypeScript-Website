If specified, `.js` (as well as `.d.ts`, `.js.map`, etc.) files will be emitted in the specified directory.
The directory structure of the original source files is preserved; see [[rootDir]] if the computed root is not what you intended.

If not specified, `.js` files will be emitted in the same directory as the `.ts` files they were generated from.

display: "Use Define For Class Fields"
---

This flag is used as a part of migrating to the upcoming standard version of how class fields works. TypeScript introduced class fields many years before it was ratified in TC39, where it had a different runtime behavior but the same syntax. This flag switches to the ECMA runtime behavior.

You can read more about the transition in [the 3.7 release notes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#the-usedefineforclassfields-flag-and-the-declare-property-modifier).

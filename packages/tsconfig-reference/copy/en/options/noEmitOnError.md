display: "No Emit On Error"
---

Do not emit compiler output files like JavaScript source code, source-maps or declarations if any errors were reported.

This defaults to false, making it easier to work with a TypeScript in a watch-like environment where you may want to see results of changes to your code in another environment before making sure all errors are resolved.

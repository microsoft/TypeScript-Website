display: "Diagnostics"
oneline: "Output additional information after a compile"

Used to output diagnostic information for debugging. This command is a subset of [`extendedDiagnostics`](#extendedDiagnostics) which are more user-facing results, and easier to interpret.

If you have been asked by a TypeScript compiler engineer to give the results using this flag in a compile, in which there is no harm in using [`--extendedDiagnostics`](#extendedDiagnostics) instead.

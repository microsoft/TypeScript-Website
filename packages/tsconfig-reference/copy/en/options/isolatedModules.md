While you can use TypeScript to produce JavaScript code from TypeScript code, it's also common to use other transpilers such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to do this.
However, other transpilers only operate on a single file at a time, which means they can't apply code transforms that depend on understanding the full type system.
This restriction also applies to TypeScript's `ts.transpileModule` API which is used by some build tools.

These limitations can cause runtime problems with some TypeScript features like `const enum`s and `namespace`s.
Setting the `isolatedModules` flag tells TypeScript to warn you if you write certain code that can't be correctly interpreted by a single-file transpilation process.

It does not change the behavior of your code, or otherwise change the behavior of TypeScript's checking and emitting process.

Some examples of code which does not work when `isolatedModules` is enabled.

#### Exports of Non-Value Identifiers

In TypeScript, you can import a _type_ and then subsequently export it:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { someType, someFunction } from "someModule";

someFunction();

export { someType, someFunction };
```

Because there's no value for `someType`, the emitted `export` will not try to export it (this would be a runtime error in JavaScript):

```js
export { someFunction };
```

Single-file transpilers don't know whether `someType` produces a value or not, so it's an error to export a name that only refers to a type.

#### Non-Module Files

If `isolatedModules` is set, namespaces are only allowed in _modules_ (which means it has some form of `import`/`export`). An error occurs if a namespace is found in a non-module file:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 1277
// @isolatedModules
namespace Instantiated {
 export const x = 1;
}
```

This restriction doesn't apply to `.d.ts` files.

#### References to `const enum` members

In TypeScript, when you reference a `const enum` member, the reference is replaced by its actual value in the emitted JavaScript. Changing this TypeScript:

```ts 
declare const enum Numbers {
  Zero = 0,
  One = 1,
}
console.log(Numbers.Zero + Numbers.One);
```

To this JavaScript:

```ts twoslash
// @showEmit
// @removeComments
declare const enum Numbers {
  Zero = 0,
  One = 1,
}
console.log(Numbers.Zero + Numbers.One);
```

Without knowledge of the values of these members, other transpilers can't replace the references to `Numbers`, which would be a runtime error if left alone (since there are no `Numbers` object at runtime).
Because of this, when `isolatedModules` is set, it is an error to reference an ambient `const enum` member.

display: "Downlevel Iteration"
oneline: "Emit more compliant, but verbose and less performant JavaScript for iteration."

Downleveling is TypeScript's term for transpiling to an older version of JavaScript.
This flag is to enable support for a more accurate implementation of how modern JavaScript iterates through new concepts in older JavaScript runtimes.

ECMAScript 6 added several new iteration primitives: the `for / of` loop (`for (el of arr)`), Array spread (`[a, ...b]`), argument spread (`fn(...args)`), and `Symbol.iterator`.
`downlevelIteration` allows for these iteration primitives to be used more accurately in ES5 environments if a `Symbol.iterator` implementation is present.

#### Example: Effects on `for / of`

With this TypeScript code:

```ts 
const str = "Hello!";
for (const s of str) {
  console.log(s);
}
```

Without `downlevelIteration` enabled, a `for / of` loop on any object is downleveled to a traditional `for` loop:

```ts twoslash
// @target: ES5
// @showEmit
const str = "Hello!";
for (const s of str) {
  console.log(s);
}
```

This is often what people expect, but it's not 100% compliant with ECMAScript iteration protocol.
Certain strings, such as emoji (ðŸ˜œ), have a `.length` of 2 (or even more!), but should iterate as 1 unit in a `for-of` loop.
See [this blog post by Jonathan New](https://blog.jonnew.com/posts/poo-dot-length-equals-two) for a longer explanation.

When `downlevelIteration` is enabled, TypeScript will use a helper function that checks for a `Symbol.iterator` implementation (either native or polyfill).
If this implementation is missing, you'll fall back to index-based iteration.

```ts twoslash
// @target: ES5
// @downlevelIteration
// @showEmit
const str = "Hello!";
for (const s of str) {
  console.log(s);
}
```

You can use [tslib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslib) via [`importHelpers`](#importHelpers) to reduce the amount of inline JavaScript too:

```ts twoslash
// @target: ES5
// @downlevelIteration
// @importHelpers
// @showEmit
const str = "Hello!";
for (const s of str) {
  console.log(s);
}
```

**Note:** enabling `downlevelIteration` does not improve compliance if `Symbol.iterator` is not present in the runtime.

#### Example: Effects on Array Spreads

This is an array spread:

```js
// Make a new array whose elements are 1 followed by the elements of arr2
const arr = [1, ...arr2];
```

Based on the description, it sounds easy to downlevel to ES5:

```js
// The same, right?
const arr = [1].concat(arr2);
```

However, this is observably different in certain rare cases.

For example, if a source array is missing one or more items (contains a hole), the spread syntax will replace each empty item with `undefined`, whereas `.concat` will leave them intact.

```js
// Make an array where the element at index 1 is missing
let arrayWithHole = ['a', , 'c'];
let spread = [...arrayWithHole];
let concatenated = [].concat(arrayWithHole);

console.log(arrayWithHole)
// [ 'a', <1 empty item>, 'c' ]
console.log(spread)
// [ 'a', undefined, 'c' ]
console.log(concatenated)
// [ 'a', <1 empty item>, 'c' ]
```

Just as with `for / of`, `downlevelIteration` will use `Symbol.iterator` (if present) to more accurately emulate ES 6 behavior.

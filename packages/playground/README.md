# TypeScript Playground

This is the JS tooling which powers the https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/

It is more or less vanilla DOM-oriented JavaScript with as few dependencies as possible. Originally based on the
work by [Artem Tyurin](https://github.com/agentcooper/typescript-play) but now it's diverged far from that fork.

## Architecture

The playground library sits above the [TypeScript sandbox](../sandbox), and provides features like:

- The code samples support
- The navigation bars, and compiler flags UI
- The sidebar plugin infrastructure for showing JS/DTS/etc
- The export to Code Sandbox/TS AST Viewer/etc features

When deciding where to add a feature to the TypeScript playground, consider if it would be useful to anyone showing
TypeScript in a REPL. If yes, add it to the sandbox and expose a function for the playground to use. For example
Automatic Type Acquisition is a feature which lives in the sandbox and not the playground because pretty much anyone showing TypeScript code would want it.

## Link Syntax

The Playground supports a set of query inputs from the URL. The hash is used to reflect the code:

- `#code/PRA` - A base64 and zipped version of the code which should live in the editor
- `#src=The%20code` - URLEncoded way to have the code for the editor
- `#example/generic-functions` - Grab the code from an example with the id generic-functions

Or to trigger some action by default:

- `#show-examples` - When the app is loaded, show the examples popover
- `#show-whatisnew` - When the app is loaded, show the examples popover

Then queries tend to be about changing the state of the Playground setup from the default:

- `?ts=3.9.2` - Sets the TypeScript version, the list of supported versions is in these [two](https://playgroundcdn.typescriptlang.org/indexes/pre-releases.json) [json](https://playgroundcdn.typescriptlang.org/indexes/releases.json) files.

  There are two special cases for the `ts` option:

  - `ts=next`: Use the most recent [nightly build](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/nightly-builds.html).
  - `ts=dev`: Use your [local developer's build of TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/scripts/createPlaygroundBuild.js)

- `?flag=value` - Any compiler flag referenced in can be set from a query
- `?filetype=js|ts|dts` - Tells the Playground to set the editor's type
